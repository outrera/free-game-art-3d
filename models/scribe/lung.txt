Hi there,

After reasonable success with my model of a human heart I decided that I would continue the idea and create some more important organs so here is a model of a pair of human lungs.

The model has 478 vertices and has an animation which you can see a demonstration of here, this model was made to be rendered as a GUI animation to represent health like the heart was, however it can be used as a 3D model quite easily as well!

I think I will make the brain when I have the chance as most likely the final installment in this set unless anyone has any specific requests.

Enjoy!

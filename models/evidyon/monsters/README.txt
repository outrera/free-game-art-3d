The DarkGDK meshes (bog-monster, gorilla and hound) are roughly based on ones
made available one Christmas by The Game Creators (thegamecreators.com) for
free, without license restriction, as part of a DarkGDK content pack give-away.

Animations and textures were redone for this project.


Erich Gluck created the other models from scratch.

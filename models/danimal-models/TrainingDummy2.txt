Mecha Training Dummy made for Open Dungeons (open source Dungeon keeper clone) and AgentKeeper (its brother-in-arms project) , 286 vertex, 274 faces, textured, with normal map, ambient oclussion(already applied to texture), specularity map and animated. It was supposed to be just a dummy but when i finished it, i felt it could be used as some kind of mob, and gave it a walking and death animation; and remember "In soviet Russia training dummies train on YOU"

++Animations should be speed up into game engine++

Contructive criticism is very welcome since i plan to do more of this guys as part of a maybe very ambitius personal game project. Being this the basic human unit that can promote to different warrior classes. I really learned a lot about modelling, texturing and animating working on it, this my best model up to date, so enjoy!

(farmworking animations are a bit lacking but i think sufficient )

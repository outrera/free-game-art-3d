Defender to be used as a Hero unit on "Opendungeons" a Dungeon Keeper open source remake: http://opendungeons.sourceforge.net/

Original model CC-BY-3 belongs to Anthony Myers: http://opengameart.org/users/anthonymyers. I Retopologized it from 30k tris to 16k tris, rigged and animated it by using CC0 Motion Capture files.

Animations: Walk, flee/run, attack1 and attack2, idle, sleep, dance, happy, sad and die; As NLA tracks, full and larger animations can be found on its "Action Editor".

There are some errors that would need fine-tuning for a first person game, but its working perfectly for its intended use as an RTS unit.

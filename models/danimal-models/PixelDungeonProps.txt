This pack has 31(plus skin variations) very low poly models using 32x32 or 64x64 textures (mainly 32x32); vertex ranging from smallest model, 8 vertex, to biggest, 240 vertex; All done by me. Photosoph source files included.

It contains the kind of props you can expect to find into a fantasy dungeon, plus foodstocks and valuables (coins and jewels).

 

My thanks go to the Open Game Art pixel community, i learned quite a bit looking at their works. I could expand this set, but im out of ideas of what else to add, if you think i missed some important bit of dungeon stuff do tell me. Also, i tried to be methodical and homogeneus, so if you find some error please tell me.

If this has a good welcome, I also intend to release in a near future other packs featuring weapons and characters when im finished with the small stuff.

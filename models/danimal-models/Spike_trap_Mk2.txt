 My thanks to skorpio from OpenDungeons forums for his artistic guidance (and for wanting me to release his modifications), if you use this model you need to give me credit. Constructive criticism is welcome, especially since this is my first normal mapped model.

Updates:

- Joined the two objects and the materials

- Added an armature

- Rebaked the ambient occlusion

- Added a specularity map (it's only visible from certain angles)

A giant egg-sack for creepy giant insects or some kind of alien plant/inmovile creature.

Poli number is high (41k) due to Subsurf activated on main body since its intended to be made into a 2d model, erasing that modifier turns its into a 6k lowpoly asset

Animated (some kind of heart beating animation):

1-30 Inflates

31-45 deflate

Modifications, rigging and animation by Danimal (thats me ;) )

4824 VERTEX AND 5958 FACES

FRAMES:

1-40 FLYING
41-60 ATTACK
61-110 IDLE(TAIL UP AND DOWN)/GUARDING(75-95)
111-120 DEATH
121 COILED/RESTING (just a pose, not a real animation)

My first real try at animation, im sure there is a lot to improve in many areas, constructive criticism is welcome. Eyes and "nose" are joined inside skull to avoid normal problems on Unity3D, empty them if you need it.

Also, i will be thankfull if someone can explain to me how should i do to make an animation in which parts of a skeleton fall apart without messing the whole animation.

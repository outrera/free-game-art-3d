Here's me as an NPC for Flare.  For the weekly challenge Get In The Game!

It's me just standing with my laptop.  Lightly animated (swaying slightly, moving my arm as if typing, and the laptop screen gives a slight flickering glow).

Created in Blender, based mostly on my existing works http://opengameart.org/content/laptop and http://opengameart.org/content/base-human-models-low-poly ... See the attached .zip for the Blend (rigged, solid colors instead of textures, not UV mapped).

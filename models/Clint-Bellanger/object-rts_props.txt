I unwrapped and put a basic texture on these models by Lamoot: http://opengameart.org/content/rts-medieval-props

The textures are all from public domain sources: Blender Texture CD for the wood, pdtextures blog for the stone, and this collection for the well roof and stonework: http://opengameart.org/content/wall-grass-rock-stone-wood-and-dirt-480

Be sure to credit Lamoot for these models.

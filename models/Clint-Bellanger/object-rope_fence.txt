Simple low-poly rope fence.

Included are:
- 3 premade, manifold fences: one regular and two irregular styles
- Individual fence posts and rope segments so that you can make your own fence
- Fence posts use a common color map.  Rope uses a common diffuse and normal map
The rope looks good but uses very little resources.  Each segment is a 6-sided cylinder with a 64x64 normal + diffuse map, repeated along the length).  Each premade fence included is just over 200 poly.

If you want a rope fence on varying elevation or at a curve you'll have to piece it together from the parts; or, contact me and I might be able to help.

If you ever wore a bowl on your head and fought monsters with a toy sword, this model is for you.

I would love to make a game on this theme, where parents keep an imaginative child busy by giving him quests to defeat monsters throughout the house, backyard, etc.

Low poly.  Unwrapped but not painted.

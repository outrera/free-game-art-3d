Everybody loves Candy! Feel free to use these in your own game saga.

Made especially for The Candy Jam http://thecandyjam.com/

Includes four iconic pieces of candy.
- Lollipop Globe (red) 432 tris, diffuse and normal
- Lollipop Disc (green) 316 tris, diffuse and normal
- Chocolate Square 76 tris, diffuse
- Peppermint 128 tris, diffuse

For the lollipops I use two materials. I keep the candy part separate so it's really easy to swap out for a different color.

Blender format with PNG textures.

(edit) updated license to CC0. This stuff is pretty simple, so I'm just going to waive attribution. Use freely!

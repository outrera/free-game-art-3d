Isometric dungeon stairs, made for Flare's dungeon tile set.

The up stairs are 256x256 and the down stairs are 256x128. They are designed for a 4x4 tile area, assuming base tile sizes of 64x32.

I've attached the Blender model used (the .zip file). Note it's not really made for a 3D game (in a fully 3D game you'd want modular stairs that actually connected properly to other floors).

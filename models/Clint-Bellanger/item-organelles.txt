Eukaryotic Organelle tiles, with attached Blender file used for rendering (see the .zip)

I think a Tower Defense type game using parts of a cell and ATP as the resource would be a great way for kids to learn about cells.

Included are:
- Rough and Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Chloroplast
- Mitocondrion
- Nucleus
- Vacuole
- Golgi Apparatus

For the weekly challenge "Educational Science"!

That preview is made with Tiled.  Use 128x64 grid size and 128x96 tile size if you're interested in trying that out.

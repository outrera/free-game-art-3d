Zombie!

Low poly.  Not UV unwrapped, but rigged with these animations:
- Stance (4 frames)
- Lurch (8 frames)
- Slam (4 frames)
- Bite (4 frames)
- Block (2 frames)
- Hit and Die (6 frames)
- Critical Death (8 frames)

I used this model to create 2D sprites for my isometric RPG.

Included is my custom Python script that renders the animation in eight directions (every 45 degrees).

Added a different zombie walk animation, cleaned up some floor clipping, and set AA to CatRom.

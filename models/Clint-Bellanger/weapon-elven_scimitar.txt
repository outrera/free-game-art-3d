A very elven-style long-handled scimitar.

Based on concept art by Naraphim, used with permission: http://naraphim.deviantart.com/art/Weapon-Set-Complete-2007-73660253 (top row, 2nd from the left)

Very low poly (178 tris).  Simple diffuse/spec/normal maps included plus baking copies.  Textures are Public Domain from the Blender Texture CD.

Because the blade's so thin I stretched the UV map vertically.  You probably want to use textures that are half as high as they are tall (e.g. 512x256) if your engine supports it.

Matches the style of my really old Elven Weapon Set: http://opengameart.org/content/elven-weapon-set

Low poly, rigged laptop.  Includes the higher poly model I used for baking.

Note, the texture doesn't include brand markings, keyboard markings, and ports.

56 tris!  Packed 1024x1024 normal and diffuse textures.  I've attached 256x256 versions as previews (the renders from those are still excellent for games).

The lid is rigged to open/close.

My Thing-A-Day item for July 4th, 2010.

(update) added a US-English keyboard layout

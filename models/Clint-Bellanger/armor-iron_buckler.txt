A low-poly iron buckler for Flare

512px diffuse, spec, normal

716 tris

Handle and arm strap not included; there is room in the texture space to add them though. Also, the front of the shield has about 50% more pixel density than the back. I figure this is acceptable because in many games you'd be seeing the front of the shield 95% of the time.

It's a bit "pristine" right now, I'll probably make another beat up version with worn edges and combat dents.

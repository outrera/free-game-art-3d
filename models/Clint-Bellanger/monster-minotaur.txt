Minotaur for OSARE.

- 4-frame stance
- 8-frame bull rush
- 4-frame swing
- 2-frame block
- 6-frame hit + die

Blender file attached.  I've included the baking file.  If I wanted to tweak the normals, I'd mirror the minotaur halves and combine them into a full minotaur before sculpting (with x-mirror enabled).

The minotaur is 1212 tris (the model is mostly quads where possible).  The axe is 736 tris.  With better texturing it could be useful in a 3D game.

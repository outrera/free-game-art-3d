24 isometric tiles for a grassy area with small streams of water.

Tiles contained:
- 4 grass variations
- 4 directions of concave bank
- 4 directions of convex bank
- 4 directions x 2 variations of straight bank
- 2 directions pinched bank
- 2 water variations

The tiles are 64x64 each on a base tile size of 64x32.

I increased the brightness/contrast slightly in post.  I'll probably use a dark version in my rpg.

Note there is a slightly visible edge line on the water tiles.  I haven't figured out how to avoid this.

Blender file attached in the .zip file.

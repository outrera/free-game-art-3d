Flying loot animations, for when you open a treasure container or kill a creature.

Set of 23, a large starting set for OSARE.  The weapons and armor styles match attached icons by Blarumyrran.

Contained:
- Dagger, Shortsword, Longsword, Greatsword
- Wand, Rod, Staff, Greatstaff
- Slingshot, Shortbow, Longbow, Greatbow
- Clothes, Leather Armor, Buckler, Steel Armor, Shield
- Health Potion, Mana Potion
- Boots, Belt, Ring, Gem

Each animation is 6 frames and 64x128 pixels.  I took the Blender output into GIMP and set the Alpha Threshold to 32 before dropping the alpha layer onto pink (255,0,255).  If you want alpha-layer animations just hit the ANIM button in the attached blender file.

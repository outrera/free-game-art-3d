Created for Flare

These animal figurines are used in Flare to boost a core stat. The animal and paint markings are thematic to the stat.
- Bear = strength = red
- Owl = intellect = blue
- Cat = agility = yellow
- Turtle = defense = green

These are very low-poly models that I used to generate simple icons and item previews. I don't mind the very low-poly look here because it helps give it a rough "wood carving" look. Specs:

- About 200 tris each
- Diffuse texture 256x256px
- Emit glow texture 256x256px
- Paint and unpainted versions included
- UV mapped
- Not rigged, and not really designed with rigging in mind

Please contact me if you'd like to use these under different terms. I'm happy to help small/indie projects.

[update] Added unpainted 512x512 alpha renders of each figurine

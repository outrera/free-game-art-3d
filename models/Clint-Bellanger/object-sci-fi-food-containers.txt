Three low-poly sci-fi containers.

Derived from the excellent concept art by Rzhanov Artem, also at OGA: http://opengameart.org/content/container

I've named them Bi, Tri, and Quad based on their radial symmetry.
- Bi: 318 tris
- Tri: 412 tris
- Quad: 372 tris

All are UV-unwrapped.  I've applied simple Blender textures to face groups for this render.

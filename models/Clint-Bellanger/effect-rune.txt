Simple teleport rune for my RPG.

Isometric view, 64x64, 4 frames.

Process: I created the simple mesh for the rune and gave it that bright green color.  I added a IPO curves to alter the Rotation of the object and Alpha of the material.  Finally I rendered using motion blur.  .blend file attached.

(Update)

Added two more in similar style.  I'm using these other two for Berzerker stance and Guardian stance.

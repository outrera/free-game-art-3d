Base animations for an old school sidescroller platformer.  Inspired by games like Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden.  These can be painted over with pixel art to make PCs and NPCs for games.

Each frame is 64x64 pixels.  The scale is 32 pixels = 1 meter, and the hero is about 6 feet tall (about 1.8 meters).

The animations included:
- Stance (4 frames)
- Run (8 frames)
- Swing weapon (4 frames)
- Block (2 frames)
- Hit and Die (6 frames)
- Cast spell (4 frames)
- Shoot bow (4 frames)
- Walk (8 frames)
- Duck (2 frames)
- Jump and Fall (6 frames)
- Ascend stairs/slope (8 frames)
- Descend stairs/slope (8 frames)
- Stand (1 frame)

These animations were applied to my male model from human-base-lowpoly.blend

I turned the hero 15 degrees towards the camera, so we're not seeing a direct profile shot.

Blender file attached.

(Updated) added a pixelized version of the output, great for a pixelart base.

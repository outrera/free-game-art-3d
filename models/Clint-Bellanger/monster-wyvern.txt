The wyvern proportions/structure inspired by this excellent concept art by Sarah Benalene.

Rendered at 256x256 per frame, 8 directions. I've included 7 animations at 8 frames each:

The 3D model should be finished enough to be useful in some 3D games. If you make tweaks to the 3D model to get it 3D game-ready, please remember to Share-Alike. Thanks!

Skeleton Warrior

Low poly 3D model rigged and animated for use in pre-rendered 2D sprites.  Because I'm only using them for small renders, they're not "finished" for use in 3D games (no UV maps, the mesh could be better optimized, etc).

Comes with these animations:
- Stance (4 frames)
- Walk (8 frames)
- Attack (4 frames)
- Cast (4 frames)
- Block (2 frames)
- Hit and Die (6 frames)
- Aim Crossbow (4 frames)

Python script included to render in 8 directions.

Includes the sword listed here http://opengameart.org/content/skull-bastard-sword which is a derived from the original concept sketch by Misha http://opengameart.org/content/bastardsword001-concept

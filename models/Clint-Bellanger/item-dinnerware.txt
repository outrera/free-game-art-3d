Low-poly dinnerware.  I created these with medieval table decorations in mind, but they may be useful for other settings.

Contains:
- Cup
- Bowl
- Plate
- Tankard
- Goblet
- Wine Bottle
- Jug
- Pitcher
- Platter
- Fork
- Knife
- Spoon

And in these materials
- Terracotta
- Silver
- Wood
- Glass (Blender raytracing only)

I've included 256x256 diffuse for terracotta, silver, and wood.  Also included 256x256 normal for terracotta and silver.

The wine bottle comes with dark glass and cork procedural textures.

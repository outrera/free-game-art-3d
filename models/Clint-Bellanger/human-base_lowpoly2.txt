Very Low Poly Human (246 tri).  Rigged, not unwrapped.

I wanted to see how low I can get with poly count and still have a usable rigged model.  Made this in a couple hours.  Maybe it'll be useful for placeholder art, making better models, or rendering thousands of tiny/background humans.

I release all copy rights and dedicate this model to the Public Domain.

A straightforward medieval weapon set, with a practical style that would be mass-produced for soldiers.

The longsword is based off the drawing Weapon Set Complete 2007 by naraphim at deviantArt -- used with permission. Tech details: Created in Blender. Click the download button for the .blend file. Low Poly (each weapon is about 80-130 faces). Contains UV mapping but I didn't include textures.

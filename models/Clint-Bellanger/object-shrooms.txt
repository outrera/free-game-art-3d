Low poly (184 tri each) mushrooms.  Should be useful for terrain decoration.  I created three variations of medium, tall, and flat.

They all use the same UV mapping (simple cylinder UV) so they're easy to paint.  I've included the base cylinder I used to create these mushrooms (it's pretty easy to make more), plus the one I used to do texture baking.

Basically I created a cylinder and did the UV mapping first.  Then I reshaped the face loops to make the mushroom shapes.  I used an 8-sided cylinder and 8 vertical sections.  I always used the bottom face loops for the stem, so that they could share the same UV textures.

(edit) added red with white spot mushroom texture as a preview

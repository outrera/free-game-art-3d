These should all work with my grass tileset: http://opengameart.org/content/unknown-horizons-tileset

And though I have not tried, with a small amount of work they may work well with Flare assets.

For the full pack grab the 'Isometric Building Pack' zip, otherwise pick and choose!

I have included the 3D models, though I would not suggest using them as 3D models in their current state as most are too highpoly for the topology.
Hope these are useful!

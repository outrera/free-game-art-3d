If you are interested in helping out on the first open source steampunk MMORPG feel free to stop by #tempest-in-the-aether on freenode. We are currently in need of people with basic skills in blender that would be able to help assemble the buildings from our prefabricated pieces as well as texture artists. If that is you drop us a line we would love for this to be your game as well.

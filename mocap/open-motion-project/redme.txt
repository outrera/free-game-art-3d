"Several ACCAD students came together to create a set of motions that are useable for motion for video games, animation, etc. The intent is that these motions are absolutely free to use with no type of restrictions. The students wanted anyone to be able to get their hands on this type of data and use it however they wanted. The data is in both bvh skeletal format and c3d point data format as well."

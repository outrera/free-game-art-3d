Cutting Edge in 1993
At the time the idea of "repeating textures" was so innovative that new techniques were invented to create these images. In fact Pixar took out several patents for the technology, developed by David DiFrancesco, which you can read more about here: https://www.google.com/patents/US5194969

Updated for 2015

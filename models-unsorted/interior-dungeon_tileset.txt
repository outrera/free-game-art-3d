this is the extended version of my 3D tileset i made before, the main preview is showing the new parts only, it also contains an animated switch.

can be used to make isometric renders, on layer 2 there is an example object used for a test-render, which can be seen in the preview too.

i used a modified version of my mug (from my mug pack), see link below.

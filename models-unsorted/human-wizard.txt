This is a model based on a concept art ( by  killyoverdrive's dark alchemist) from the concept art section of this website. The model didn't quite turn out the way I wanted and so I decided to stop working on it and so there is no animations for it. 

The model has 4096x4096 color and normal map and a 1024x1024 emission map.

Total of 2630 triangles.

blend file format.

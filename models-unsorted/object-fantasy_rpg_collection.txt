i made 50 models for fantasy RPGs,

in this pack are:

torches, temple-alike-models, fences, walls and towers, bridges, a wooden cart, treasure chests, candle holders, pillars, gates, statue-holders and more

the preview images show only 20 of 50 models and they aren't textured or unwrapped because of the huge amount.

some models have variations (see 3rd preview image), in the blend-file they are overlapping in some cases.

 

onother use is for making isometric graphics out of it after texturing.

"Changes by MrBeast:
Replaced the lighting setup with a different (better) one.
Fixed many texture parameters.
Made armor "tintable". You can choose the basic color by simply changing the color of the material, the secondary color can be changed by changing the color under "RGB to intensity" of the "armor_diff" texture. Clothing is also tintable, however there is only a primary color.
Added a texture to the beard.
Changed the skin color a bit.
Made an less arkward color scheme default.

Note:
This is for Blender 2.5."

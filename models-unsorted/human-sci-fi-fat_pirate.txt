This is FatSpacePirate facial animation i made for Privateer Gemini Gold intro.
If you know the game, he's the pirate who is seen in the green monitor inside Burrows spaceship Taurus.
Eventually this was not used in the intro.

Made in Blender.

Textured, has shapekeyes for most phenomes. And lipsync animation but soundfile is not included.

This was my first facial animation.

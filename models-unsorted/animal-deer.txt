This is a deer in a low poly art style.

I have included both the non rigged and rigged versions.

However i am still new to animation (about 3 months so it's a fairly simple rig). I also included .obj and .3ds formats as not everyone uses blender :) I modeled it from several references however as i am still new to animation, i included the editable blend file (before applying the mirror modifier in case you feel i made any mistakes)

Vertice count: 414

I modeled it for an animation project, and i will be releasing a number of the other assets such as the soldiers,fire tornado, grass, fire, barn and crops after i clean them up.

If there are any other models in the animation you want, kindly tell me and i will release them under the CC ZERO license as well. :)

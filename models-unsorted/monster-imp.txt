Blend file contain 2 models, a low poly with about 3k triangles and a medium poly with abou 11k triangles. There are 6 textures, 3 for each model and all at 4096 resolution and they are responsible for most of the size of the file (the specular maps can be much smaller but I included the full size one in case you want it).

Donations appreciated and they will be used to improve my 3D through new software or extra time spent on the models. They can be done using this paypal link.

Fantasy creature based on Ancient Beasts concept art by Katarzyna Zalecka. There are a couple models included in the blend file. One has about 3k triangles and the other about 5k. Textures are included and are all resolution 1024x1024. Models are not rigged.

Donations appreciated and they will be used to improve my 3D through new software or extra time spent on the models. They can be done using this paypal link.

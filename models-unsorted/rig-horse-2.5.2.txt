Note from Bart:  I contacted the artist on the forum thread.  While the rig was originally released under CC-BY 2.5, he agreed to release it under CC-BY 3.0.  He says:

"sure, any of my rigs are free to use for whatever you feel like (commercial or non-commericial)
you can credit me if you feel like it, but it's not necessary 
I would like to see where they end up, even if people are just practicing with them :)"

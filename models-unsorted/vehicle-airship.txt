Here is a an airship model created by my good friend Inazuma. He makes some awesome 3D models as well as some very impressive pixel art. He let me have this model to edit and texture for use in my project: Washed Up. 

Now that the project is long over, Inazuma gave me permission to share this model with anyone who might have use for it! The Model was made primarily for use in SMILE GAME BUILDER, but you may use it elsewhere. Enjoy!

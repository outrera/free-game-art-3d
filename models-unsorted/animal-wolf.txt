This is a wolf in a low poly art style.

I also included .obj and .3ds formats for those who don't use blender :)

After Studying a wolf's anatomy and going through some quadruped blender tutorial i was able to make a simple rig for the wolf.

I also add a spline IK for the Tail

 

I have included both the non rigged and rigged versions.

 

I did not apply the Mirror Modifier yet in case you want to make any changes.

 

Hope you find it useful :)

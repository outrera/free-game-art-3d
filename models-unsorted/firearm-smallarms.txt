This is a collection of relatively low-poly firearms.  The iron sites are fairly detailed and line up appropriately for realistic applications.  The bolts / slides for most weapons are also animated.

It has the following:
- AK-47
- M4 / AR-15
- Dragunov (SVD)
- G3A3
- L85A1
- Mosin Nagant 91/30
- M1911

These do not have UV textures, only Blender materials.

I made 2 medieval buildings for the flare game. More of this type are planned in future.

They are modelled and made by me, including textures from own photos. (Except these CC0 barrels from yd)

Included are a snowy / winter variant, with sun shadow, cloudy shadow and no shadow and 2 resolutions (for 128x64 and 64x32 isometric games)

The source blend file is large, unpacked 94,5 MB, also the rendered output is edited a bit with gimp, re-rendering will give slightly different results.

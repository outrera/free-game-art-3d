2 models of earth elementals that are slightly different.

They have 10 animations and are already set up for Unity.

Models were made in blender and exported to fbx so they should be easy to import to blender.

Both models are in the range of 3872-3882 triangles. 

Comment below if anything is broken or not working and if feasible I'll fix it. 

Donations appreciated and they help me justify to my wife the time spent on making 3D. They can be done using this paypal link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=CCW3SXJZARA5W&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted

This is a model I stopped working on. It is a high poly model and it is composed of a few separate objects that contain their own UV and textures. The weapons protruding out of the body are retractable, and by that I mean that if you create a shape key that makes the cylinders retreat towards their base and move the base towards the body it will be fairly hard to notice they are there.

Donations appreciated and they will be used to improve my 3D through new software or extra time spent on the models. They can be done using this paypal link.

Simple windmill that I made. It also has an inside area. Enjoy it. The textures and the blend file are in the zip.

Donations appreciated and they help me justify to my wife the time spent on making 3D. They can be done using this paypal link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=CCW3SXJZARA5W&lc=US&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted

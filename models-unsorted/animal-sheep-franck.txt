Franck from the open movie "cosmos laundromat" - game ready - rigged and animated

this model is based on the origin sheep model from the blender open movie "cosmos laundromat", which is licensed under cc-by (i downloaded it from https://cloud.blender.org/p/characters/567927bac379cf211051a67a)

I use this character in my game laundred sheep ( repositories can be found here: https://notabug.org/rbduck), the game itself is in a beta phase and a bit buggy too.

A website for the game and more information about it is coming soon.
